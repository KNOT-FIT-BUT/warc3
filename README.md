WARC (Web ARChive) is a file format for storing web crawls (see http://bibnum.bnf.fr/WARC/).

## Examples

This `warc` library makes it straightforward to work with WARC files:
```python
import warc
with warc.open("test.warc") as f:
    for record in f:
        print(record['WARC-Target-URI'], record['Content-Length'])
```

And WET files:
```python
import warc
with warc.open("test.warc.wet") as f:
    for record in f:
        print(record['WARC-Target-URI'], record['Content-Length'])
```

There are some examples provided without a warranty and support (just for inspiration)
in [examples](https://github.com/KNOT-FIT-BUT/warc3/tree/master/examples) folder.
They are not updated at all, too.
